            <p>Hello! My name is Michael Song, and I am a junior at the University of Waterloo's Computing and Financial Management program. I was born in China, moved to Vancouver when I was two years old, and made stops in London, New York City, and Toronto before eventually settling in Markham. </p>
            <p>In my childhood, I spent most of my free time as a professional chess player. Arguably my greatest achievement came at the age of 12, where I placed 3rd at the World Youth Chess Championships. Afterwards, I took a break from youth chess and decided to test my skills against stronger competition. Several years of grinding later, I achieved the title of International Master in 2016. Having achieved this goal, I went back to youth chess for fun, winning the 2016 North American Youth Championship and the 2017 Pan-American Youth Championship along the way.</p>
            <p>It was around that time where I saw university coming up on the horizon and realized my professional playing days were coming to an end. This prompted me to give back to the Canadian chess community. Hence, in 2017, I served as the National Coach of Team Canada at the World Youth Chess Championships, where I helped a student place 7th in the world! I also authored and published "The Chess Attacker's Handbook" internationally, in order to inspire future Canadian chess players to author their own works as well. You can find the book by clicking on the Amazon icon in the website's footer!</p>
            <p>Today, I am incredibly passionate technology and finance (you can probably tell by my fields of study!). My professional experience consists of internships in Software Engineering, Venture Capital, Quantitative Finance and Equity Research. I am currently looking for my next co-op term for January-April 2021 (primarily in software roles), so feel free to reach out to be if you think I would be a good fit!</p>
            <p>Outside of work and school, I am a huge NBA fan; my favorite team is (unfortunately) the New York Knicks. I'm also a big New York Yankees fan, and I'm confident they'll bring home a World Series title in coming years. My other interests include poker, photography, drone flying, and binge-watching "The Office".</p>
